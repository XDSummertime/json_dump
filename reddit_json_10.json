Im tired of how even the littlest thing can send him into a fit of rage. And honestly I find the inability to control his emotion so incredibly unattractive. Every time I see him express his anger in that way, I like him a little less. </p> <p>Is there anything I could do here? Is my only option breaking up? He is never angry at me or doing anything bad to me though.
