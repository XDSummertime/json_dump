They got laid off from a dream job that turned out to be incredibly stressful and in a way, the layoff was a relief. However in that time they have not gotten another job, not even an interim retail job to pay the bills. I am usually very supportive of taking time to reflect between jobs, but we are not in the financially privileged space to do that. I work part time and I am in graduate school so I cannot pay for everything. For several months I have been begging my partner to try harder to find something to help us pay the bills. They have brought in money recently by selling some expensive stuff they bought with money they inherited around 5 years ago, which had been purchased as an investment towards some creative goals. However, I have been very clear that I don\u2019t want to just rely on re-selling things to make cash; I need to see a steady paycheck, and I need to know we are planning to build a future together by creating goals and thinking ahead.</p> <p>When we got together, everything seemed perfect. (I know, it always does.) From our conversations, it seemed like we had all the same goals and the same dreams for our future. We wanted to enjoy creative pursuits, travel, have a modest but comfortable home, and maybe have a kid someday. As the relationship has continued and since we moved in together, their actions just have not matched up to their words. I am in a graduate program with a clear career direction, and they seem to be drifting around waiting for an opportunity to arise or a career path to show itself. Their layoff happened right after we moved in together which was awful timing. They have been applying to jobs for the past few months since their unemployment payments ran out, but it was a really slow start. I can really sympathize with this because I spent many years in my 20s bouncing from job to job without a clear idea of what I wanted career-wise. I can also sympathize with their struggles to focus. They are neurodivergent and so am I - this is something that really drew us together and helped us understand each other. This brings up another issue though: I have been really trying to encourage them to go to therapy for depression and to help with their neurodivergent symptoms, and they have resisted. I even reached out to several therapists for them, and when they got responses they told me they got too overwhelmed and never scheduled anything. They just seem so stuck and it is hard to witness. </p> <p>Is it worth being patient as I have been for them to figure out what\u2019s next and work towards our goals together? Part of me feels like it really has not been that long since losing their job for me to be upset - I know people who have been out of work for much longer than this after layoffs. The biggest issue is that my distress has not seemed to impact their efforts to find work, or collaborate with me to plan for the future.</p> <p>Another major issue is that two of my closest friends have told me they will no longer speak to me if I don\u2019t leave my partner. I had been complaining about the relationship for the past few months, admittedly enough that I can understand why they don\u2019t want to hear about it anymore. These two friends (one I have had since middle school and lives in my hometown, and one I have known for a long time but lives in my current city) connected with each other and seem to have made a concerted effort to force me out of the relationship. I only say this because on the same day they both told me they had spoken and could not be in my life until my partner is no longer in my life. They claim I am being financially abused (which I don\u2019t agree with, since I have only had to pay the whole rent myself one time and on top of that my partner maybe owes me $200 total), but I think that phrasing was an extreme attempt to get me to \u201cwake up.\u201d I feel infantilized by how they have treated me about the situation, as if they think I don\u2019t understand what is happening. I do understand I am being taken advantage of. I just can\u2019t seem to dim the hope I have, which is based on the love we have for each other and the ways my partner HAS shown me they care and want to change. I also wish they could have just told me they don\u2019t want to talk about the relationship anymore, rather than saying they can\u2019t be in my life while I make these choices at all \u201cfor their own sake.\u201d These friends have never really meshed with my partner to begin with since they have VERY different vibes. My partner is very shy in groups of new people, and these friends have huge personalities and can be pretty intimidating (not just to my partner, this has been reported by others too.) </p> <p>What am I supposed to do?? I feel so lost, and now very isolated since these friends who cut me off are enmeshed in groups of my other friends. They want me to leave my partner but it feels like now my partner is all I have.
