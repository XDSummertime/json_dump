(Jody) and (Hank) were blindsided by this and obviously shattered, and with this shared experience they were there for each other in what I was led to believe was a support system type situation, and as time went on both began to move forward in life.

Rick and Amy were getting ready to get married and went on a trip with one of their friends (Sam) [45/M] and at some point Amy and Sam were alone talking and it came up that Rick and my wife had slept together a few times before she and I had met and E sent a text message to my wife while we were laying in bed saying they were supposed to be friends and how Jody and Rick had lied to her for years. I saw the look on her face and asked what was wrong and she showed it to me, I was floored and hurt and asked was it true?!? She said well its not like it&#39;s a secret or something to that effect and started crying, but it was a secret or I would have known and I had always let her know if someone I had been with was going to be somewhere we would be so she wasn&#39;t in an awkward situation not knowing and to have the option to say we shouldn&#39;t go. I said I couldn&#39;t talk right then because I needed to process it and went in the living room for a few hours. </p> <p>The next morning I texted Rick and told him to call me. He did and began saying he was so sorry it was before you ever came around and was never a real or serious situation and that they went on some practice dates together to help get us comfortable with it since neither had dated for so long and since they had know each other for so many years it made it easier to begin again. I told him honestly that he was fine, it wasn&#39;t his place to tell me and after what they went through I understood the need for some sort of closeness but I wanted to know exactly how that topic came up between Amy and Sam. He said he had ran up to the room and Sam just started talking about it with Amy and that Sam wasn&#39;t really that good of a friend and was kind of an asshole and he had been thinking about dropping him from his life but that he would get the whole story and call me back. I stayed to myself, realized what my wofe had told me was true after reading through their texts from years ago (that it was only a few times over a couple months and there was absolutely no overlap) and he eventually called me two days later saying Amy and Sam were just talking about how Rick was the best person they&#39;ve ever known and he was basically &quot;the perfect human&quot; as he went on about himself and it was a total misunderstanding which is when I let go of two days worth of anger. I told him I knew the time-line from the texts and I had no anger to him about what happened before me because I have a past of my own but that if Sam ever said my wife&#39;s name or mentioned her again that I would break his jaw because he couldn&#39;t say anything with it world shut and that the text message was the most immature and chicken shit thing I&#39;ve ever seen and he better get things handled with her or she would be hearing from me. He said he understood and since then for a year there has been no communication, keeps to himself away from us at little league games and even though they did get married she (Amy) hasn&#39;t shown up to anything related to the kids knowing we or one of us will be there. </p> <p>The problem is that I do understand the need for the closeness and a sort of comfort after some like what Jody and Rick went through, but it creeps into my mind and the anger of that night and text comes back and it&#39;s almost impossible to get rid of it. I know why she didn&#39;t tell me thinking it would never come up and we don&#39;t have any real problems outside of this so I don&#39;t hold it over her but it still feels like a lie through omission. So I&#39;m asking for advise. How do I not let this creep into my mind? How can I let it go when it does? How do I not get the anger when I see him at a game even though he has been respectful enough to keep his distance and keep Amy away?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/NoRecording5456\"> /u/NoRecording5456 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/18j64zv/repostingwife_41f_introduced_old_fwb_40m_as/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/18j64zv/repostingwife_41f_introduced_old_fwb_40m_as/\">[comments]</a></span>"}], "summary": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>(TLDR) The whole story is below and actually more helpful in understanding everything but found out after a few years someone my wife introduced to me as a friend was actually someone she had hooked up with a few times before we met and I&#39;m asking for some advice with the anger it has and does cause me.</p> <p>My wife [41/F] (Jody) married her high school sweetheart [41/M] (Hank) and he had an affair with his coworker (Alicia) [40/F].
