Our relationship is generally happy and we get along hunky-dory on the day-to-day, but I&#39;m starting to wonder if we&#39;re compatible in the long run. We&#39;ve communicative and on the same page about what we want (both ambivalent about marriage, same work/life balance mindset, both open to but undecided on kids, looking to buy a house sometime in the next five years) but I worry that I will be putting in a lot more work toward these goals because of our personality differences. I&#39;m organized and action-oriented, always turning my attention to the next thing I want to do or work on about myself, whereas he is passive and slow to follow up on things unless he is directly asked. It&#39;s hard to describe because this is less about housework, as he&#39;s a very responsible roommate, and more about his own personal ambition and initiative. </p> <p>For example, he changed careers earlier this year after over a decade but has come to loathe his new job, which he finds boring, low-paying, and with no opportunity to advance. He&#39;s known that he wants to look for something else for almost five months but has not done anything beyond google &quot;jobs in my area&quot; a couple times, usually because I prompted him to do so. If I don&#39;t ask, he will push it off for weeks, even though he&#39;s visibly unhappy and has less energy than before. I have offered to help him look for jobs, craft a resume, etc. but he usually just says thanks and doesn&#39;t take me up on it. He is unhappy that he doesn&#39;t have money and that work is soul-sucking but he isn&#39;t taking the steps to fix it. </p> <p>Another example: he has a hobby that he loves, but needs to find other people to participate with him because we recently moved to a new area. It isn&#39;t particularly difficult to find other people in this hobby, it&#39;s a common one, but he hasn&#39;t done much to try to meet people. He talked to one person from a local group online but it didn&#39;t go anywhere, mostly because he never followed up with texting the guy to make plans. Instead, he stays home and works on the hobby alone while he watches TV. He admits that he is unfulfilled but doesn&#39;t take action, even, again, with offers of help. I&#39;ve tried to offer other hobbies we could do together, and have expressed interest in going places and trying new things, but if I&#39;m not the one to schedule it (hobbies or dates or anything) it won&#39;t happen. I asked him outright to plan something for our anniversary and it came and went. It really hurts to see him undermine himself and see him suffer as a result, not to mention my own pain of feeling like I&#39;m responsible for everything in my life and our life together, and a sizeable chunk of his life, too. </p> <p>It&#39;s always been like this but it hasn&#39;t always been this bad. If this sounds like depression you&#39;re probably not wrong, but therapy is another thing he won&#39;t take the initiative on. He was diagnosed with anxiety and ADHD when he was in college but didn&#39;t like how the meds made him feel, so he self-medicates with weed, which is good for his anxiety but probably sapping a lot of his initiative too. I think he smokes more than he used to. He gets in his head about self-doubt and just can&#39;t get out of his own way. When I&#39;ve brought up going to therapy he explains that he just needs a lot of time to think and wants to do things on his own timeline. In my experience, though, if he doesn&#39;t get prompted about these things, he won&#39;t do anything. It took him basically a year from when he decided to leave his last job, which was very high stress and underpaid, to actually leave, and it would&#39;ve been longer without my pleading with him to leave a job he hated. When he did quit, he spent two months living off savings while he played video games, then scrambled when his money dried up and took basically the first job he found. When he finally decided to apply for a medical card so he could smoke weed legally (which in my state just requires a virtual rubber-stamp visit with a doctor and a one-time fee), it was only because he was forced to; we moved somewhere new and he didn&#39;t have a plug, and he&#39;s definitely reliant on weed. Even then he needed my help to actually find a website, submit the documentation, and schedule the appointment. He won&#39;t pay his taxes, so I do it for him every year so he can get a refund. He says he feels guilty about it but nothing changes. </p> <p>I don&#39;t really care what he does for work or hobbies, I just want him to be happy, healthy, and well-rounded. But I can&#39;t make him do anything, and I don&#39;t want to become a nag, OR burn myself out because I&#39;m getting his shit together for him. I&#39;ve been thinking about this for a while but it&#39;s really coming up for me now because his mom (whom he has a good relationship with but is exhausting to be around, so he limits his contact with her - to her dismay) has started to text the two of us in a group chat about making plans to visit, when she used to just text him directly. This might just be a consequence of us being together for so long, but I also think she knows that I&#39;m more likely to respond to a message than him. This is annoying! I&#39;m not her son&#39;s keeper, and he should be the one to manage their relationship, not me. I&#39;ve brought this up to him, but he just kind of says &quot;I know&quot; to me and ignores her message and doesn&#39;t bring it up again. </p> <p>I know all this makes him sound terrible, but he is really a wonderful guy - he is very supportive, sweet, creative, thoughtful, intelligent, and loving, on top of a million other great qualities. He does more than his fair share of housework and treats me with total respect. I just don&#39;t know how to support him when he&#39;s the one who needs to get his own shit together, but I don&#39;t want to do nothing and be with someone who doesn&#39;t, and won&#39;t, get their shit together. I recently got diagnosed with an autoimmune disease and I burst into tears when trying to find a specialist, not because of the diagnosis really, but because I could never go to him for help in managing this sort of thing. He is endlessly emotionally supportive and empathetic but if I asked him to help me find a doctor or figure out my insurance, I don&#39;t think he could do it. I love him very much but I need a partner that can take initiative to manage more of these things on their own, and maybe go out of their way to take initiative on other things too. Sometimes I feel a little like I&#39;m dating a teenager who is still just learning how to cope with being self-reliant in life, or maybe just someone who learned to think &quot;self-reliant&quot; means &quot;doing the bare minimum in my life to get by&quot;. I find myself wondering about the future, about what it would be like if we had kids, or if I got sick for a long time and couldn&#39;t manage things - would he step up to the challenge or would the issue just get worse? Would he leave entirely? That&#39;s a really risky gamble and I would hate to regret choosing a life with someone who makes my life worse in the long run. I daydream about a miraculous, divine wake up call happening to him, one that doesn&#39;t have to come from me giving him an ultimatum about our relationship. </p> <p>TL;DR: My boyfriend doesn&#39;t take initiative to better himself but won&#39;t go to a therapist to help his mental health. I love him but don&#39;t want to live my life with someone who won&#39;t help himself and refuses my help, too.
