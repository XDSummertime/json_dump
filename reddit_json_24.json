She went home and I never expected to hear from her again, but I did the next day... and the next day... and the day after that.

She apologized, said I deserve better, said she probably isn&#39;t ready to be in a relationship... but I told her I forgive her.

She&#39;s so distant and littered with guilt, I don&#39;t know what to do other than tell her I love her and that she still means a lot to me. Am I the idiot for saying that? I am so in love with this woman and I&#39;m hurt but I&#39;d rather work through this with her because I think it&#39;s a hump we can overcome.
