We were 17 and dated throughout college. He is perfect in every way. He treats me with respect, we have a great sex life, his family loves me, I love his family, he is a hard worker, takes care of me when I am sick, and he truly cares about me. We rarely fight, probably once or twice a year, and when we do we make up the same day. The only issue is that he saved up for an apartment together and we are planning to move in together.<br/> Ever since he told me about his plan I have been having second thoughts on the relationship. I feel since we met at such a young age, we should both explore different people to grow and see what we like. I guess the other issue is he wants multiple kids and I don&#39;t really want to have kids. Just the thought of carrying a child inside of me scares me. That on top of the climate crisis makes me not want to have kids. We have talked about it but he is still dead set on, getting a house, marriage, and kids. I don&#39;t know what I want out of life. I guess it also has to do with fitness. He let himself go a bit as where I go on run or hike 5 times a week. I told him to go with me but he is always too tired from work. He isn&#39;t that out of shape but I feel like we are not equal in attractiveness. I know I shouldn&#39;t care about that stuff but it is hard not to. I still find him attractive but I feel like he doesn&#39;t put as much effort into his appearance. The most he does is shower and shave and he is ready, as I have a whole skin care routine, I don&#39;t use as much make up as I feel it makes my skin break out more, I have outfits ready, I wax my entire body and face, and shower everyday. I do all of this for him but he doesn&#39;t do much for me. I have told him to work out and go on runs with me but again, he works all day. Also, I am more of a creative person and he is more of a technical person. I want to break up with him and see what it is like to date other people, but I feel like that would be a huge mistake in the long run. My friends constantly tell me horror stories of the men they date. I just fear I will never know what is the right decision. If I break up with him and regret it, I know it was a mistake. If I stay, I will never know. Other than the appearance thing, he is the perfect partner. Help convince me that the grass isn&#39;t always greener.</p> <p>tl;dr I want to break up with my perfect boyfriend due to lack of experience.
