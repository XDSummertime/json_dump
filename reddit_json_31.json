Things were going fine in my opinion, we texted everyday, called each other on our work breaks and if we called outside of work we\u2019d talk for hours. He\u2019s got some trust issues which I don\u2019t mind working with but it puts a strain on the relationship I think bc I want to be emotionally intimate and he seems to flea at the sight of it. Well I tried to get to know him a little and brought up the topic of his past and why he has such a hard time trusting and since then he\u2019s been distant. The conversation completely slowed to a text a day and then nothing for like 2 weeks now. I\u2019ll admit I\u2019m an anxious partner and I\u2019ve been trying to give him space so I haven\u2019t reached out either but I\u2019m considering not sending him a Christmas gift. He says he doesn\u2019t like gifts but when I\u2019ve sent or given him things before he seemed happy about it. One of them was a gift card he still hasn\u2019t used bc he said no one gives him things ever so he kept it. We talked about gifting this year and I\u2019m not expecting anything back bc he said his budget is really tight, he lost his job and is dealing with this whole unemployment thing at work so it\u2019s totally understandable. What\u2019s making me question sending him one is really this huge drop on communication, it feels very much like he\u2019s just not that into me and by sending him something maybe I\u2019m over gifting and not only making him uncomfortable but putting to much into a relationship that may not be working.
