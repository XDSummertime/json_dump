We decided that he would move into my house and he&#39;s been here for a year already. I&#39;m sure it is because we now live together (prior: we only saw each other twice a week) that I am noticing his lack of hygiene. He will go to work (sometimes) without showering that morning or the night before. He wears hats that are stained from sweat. His car is gross, with soda bottles and random stuff in there on the floor. I remember being so annoyed that I had to step in garbage (multiple times) when I entered the passenger seat of his car. He smokes cigarettes and smells like it. His feet get crusty and sometimes smell bad. He mentioned not going to the dentist for 10 years and then when I responded with shock, he made an appointment. Over the years, he has put on belly weight as well. A number of times, he has smelled during sex (mainly his genitals) and I would tell him in a kind manner, as to not embarrass him. Before we have sex, I think &quot;did he wash his hands? am I going to smell some ball sweat if I go down on him?&quot; I want to just be in the moment. I have gotten multiple UTI&#39;s this year and really think it is because of him.
