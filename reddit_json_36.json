We\u2019ve talked about this several times and he always says he\u2019s going to change and then doesn\u2019t. For example last weekend I made plans for us to go to dinner and he cancelled on me twice and when we finally went I felt as though I was forcing him to take me. And the weekend before last, we had dinner plans as well and he stood me up to drink and have dinner with his friend and he didn\u2019t come home until 1am(he also lied about this and claimed he was working late and I had to pry the truth out of him). I just feel constantly exhausted, disappointed, unfulfilled, and lonely since I\u2019ve moved in with him I feel like he doesn\u2019t care to put any really effort into the relationship and it feels almost one sided. I don\u2019t really have anyone I could talk to this about or ask for advice so any advice would be appreciated thanks. </p> <p>TL;DR: In my 7 year relationship, moving in together this year has highlighted issues.
