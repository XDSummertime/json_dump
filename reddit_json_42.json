I\u2019m currently a senior in high school and I\u2019ve been hopping from school to school since I was young. In total I\u2019ve been to 8 different schools since kindergarten. Constantly loosing friends as I go from school to school. Most of this was caused by us not owning a house and whenever our rent would get increased we had to pack up and move. I would make a couple friends after a year or two at a school and just like that we had to move and those friends were ripped away from me. Now that I\u2019m in high school I have a steady friend group that accepts me as their own. We hang out and I go to their house and things like that. Only problem is they are terrible friends for me. They make me feel like shit and some of them are very homophobic and I am gay so if I ever came out to them it would immediately be a shit show. </p> <p>There\u2019s one friend in particular who I\u2019m the closest to and it\u2019s B. (I\u2019m just gonna call him B I don\u2019t want to use real names.) recently B has been treating me horribly and the worst part is he genuinely doesn\u2019t even recognize how he treats people. Either that or he just chooses not to care. For example last week we went to the mall and we agreed to walk around and just fuck around and have fun. Apparently his idea of \u201cfucking around\u201d was going around stealing stuff. </p> <p>He stole 3 shirts and each time he took one I tried telling him to put it back and he would respond n by telling me \u201cstop being a <em>female dog</em> and stop worrying about it\u201d when I brought up that stealing is degenerate shit to do he doesn\u2019t even take into account what I\u2019m saying but instead just says \u201cI saw it and I wanted it so I took it simple as that\u201d it genuinely didn\u2019t even seem to register in his brain that what he was doing was degenerate behavior and when I tried to reason with him he instead just kept saying I was being a <em>female dog</em> and that he wanted it so he took it. He literally doesn\u2019t value my opinion or what I say at all. </p> <p>I told him it made me upset because whenever he believes something he won\u2019t even listen to what anyone else has to say and instead just shuts his ears and repeats the same thing over and over again refusing to even try to believe anything else. In his mind stealing was a casual everyday thing and I think that\u2019s just how he was raised.</p> <p>I also remember about a month ago I got my first paycheck from my job (it\u2019s the same place he used to work at) and for some reason I didn\u2019t get paid for all the hours I worked. I was really upset about it and instead of explaining it to me he just kept saying \u201cI don\u2019t know what you expected\u201d and \u201chonestly what did you even expect\u201d this got me so pissed off I just got up and said \u201cwtf is wrong with you?\u201d. Instead of just explaining how the pay periods worked he just kept questioning my intelligence. </p> <p>I finally broke and said \u201cthe problem I have with you is that you don\u2019t treat me as an equal and you talk to me like I don\u2019t mean shit at all\u201d and he immediately got defensive and aggressive and started saying \u201cthen do something about it! Then do something about it!\u201d And eventually I just gave up and walked out. The way he almost immediately tried to provoke violence with me really rubbed me the wrong way but I brushed it off. </p> <p>I\u2019ve had the conversation like this with him several times and he just gets defensive and insists that he\u2019s doing his best and that he\u2019s not doing anything wrong</p> <p>Also he\u2019s just emotionally unavailable for me even though I\u2019m always there for him. When he wants to vent about his family or talk to me about some bullshit that happened to him I\u2019m always willing to listen, validate how he feels, and be a good friend. When I vent to him he immediately just starts questioning and invalidating how I feel and maybe if I\u2019m lucky he\u2019ll throw in a couple of \u201cdamn\u201ds for me. I just feel like I\u2019m always the one putting in the most effort in the friendship. We probably wouldn\u2019t even talk if I wasn\u2019t the one texting him.</p> <p>I just feel like these events really leave a stain on our friendship. We have our really good moments but when things get rough with him it\u2019s as bad as you could possibly imagine. I\u2019m just worried that if I were to stop being friends with him then I would loose the whole friend group, as well as other friends outside the friend group because he is friends with them as well. I\u2019m just terrified of being alone again. I know exactly how it feels trying to navigate life all alone and I don\u2019t want to do it again. I never had a girlfriend or boyfriend before so I can\u2019t rely on that type of relationship either. I\u2019m really terrified and stuck and I feel sick. Any advice is appreciated. </p> <p>TL;DR: my friendship situation is pretty bad. My closest friend treats me bad and puts in no effort, all my other friends are mutual friends with him so if I cut things off it\u2019ll be awkward and weird. My other friend is homophobic. If I end up alone, idk what I\u2019d do.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ThrowRAHuman-242\"> /u/ThrowRAHuman-242 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/18isj5m/i_18m_have_been_staying_in_a_shitty_friendship/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/18isj5m/i_18m_have_been_staying_in_a_shitty_friendship/\">[comments]</a></span>"}], "summary": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Making friends has always been hard for me.
