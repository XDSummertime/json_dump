I know this topic is a recurring theme for this sub but i feel like there might be people here in the best places to impart wisdom/advice at dealing with this lol. Reading stories here has made me feel so validated &amp; supported.<br/> I am posting because i have been going through a bit of a crisis - mostly internal. For background, i&#39;m 23F, south asian, Pakistani living in the west as an international student. I had a horrible childhood with classic overbearing, religious, conservative hindu parents. I knew I wanted to leave and have worked immensely hard. I escaped for undergrad, now i&#39;m working and paying my own tuition. I have worked so so hard to unlearn self-hating and self-sabotaging behaviour.. it took years to go from serious self harm and suicidal tendencies to.. just not doing them. It&#39;s a tough fight. But i&#39;ve built a support system, I&#39;ve done well with my studies and career and i&#39;m satisfied with where i am in life. except, when it comes to family and relationship.<br/> I&#39;ve been in a relationship since 8 years with a muslim guy, 23 as well. I say muslim because he&#39;s from a muslim family, but he&#39;s an atheist. We&#39;ve both grown up together and i absolutely adore this guy. To this day, he melts my heart. Sharing anything with him excites me and brings me so much happiness and it&#39;s always been special. I&#39;m an atheist myself too - we&#39;ve both bonded over theology and criticism of religion for years. However, the relationship has been very obviously forbidden for our religious backgrounds. My parents found out a couple times - turned into hell. Dad said he will kill himself if i stay in it, mom begged me to not bring shame onto the family and basically told me that i cannot think my life is mine, it is the family&#39;s. My boyfriend&#39;s family is strictly muslim as well - we don&#39;t see them fully accepting. My boyfriend accepts this and is ok with being disowned by them in the future. I, on the other hand... can&#39;t get over the tragedy. It makes me extremely anxious. I want to build a future with him, I see that as my way of designing my own life, one that does not involve conservatism and religious orthodoxy. But the words of my parents and the pressures of my culture are so so hard to unlearn.<br/> Every time I see a wedding, anybody&#39;s, i get triggered. I feel like a scandal. A horrible daughter who thought nothing of her parents. My friends, who are south asian too, have been moving through life so much smoother. Their parents are supportive of their boyfriends, talk to them about all kinds of things whereas my parents still think talking to boys is shameful. i feel so dirty about myself. anyway, i&#39;m not really sure what i need. I&#39;ve spiralled into this mental space lots of times before and gotten out, mostly by becoming deadly busy with work and studying and forgetting. Now i&#39;m burnt out. I need to look at my life differently, more positively. I need to deal with the shame more directly. Anyway, if you feel like this connected with you, or you have a similar experience, tools, wisdom on how you worked through these thoughts, i would love to talk.
