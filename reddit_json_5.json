I&#39;ve lately been feeling pretty burnt out and am feeling really frustrated with my husband of 7 years. We just had another fight and I&#39;m starting to care less and less as each one happens.</p> <p>He&#39;s currently a SAHD, and has been my entire son&#39;s (1y) life, as well as nonworking before then. Ever since becoming a SAHD he&#39;s been exhausted. I understand it is a lot of work being a SAHD, which is why every work night after I get home from work, I take care of our son for the rest of the night which includes bath time and making dinner/feeding him (which leaves him ~4.5 hours (until 10pm) that he can do whatever he wants with). I also do the dishes every night and take care of garbage / recycling, and when I have the energy I pick up after our son.</p> <p>My husband and I recently got hit with Covid pretty hard. Now that we&#39;re all feeling better and no longer contagious, my father was able to pick up our son for the day today which was a great relief for both of us.</p> <p>He spent the entire day on the couch watching a show. I had to work, but thankfully it was slow today (finally), so I was able to relax a little myself - I didn&#39;t get off the hook from work, but lately it&#39;s been really stressful, so it was nice not to have added stress today. </p> <p>Let me be clear, it&#39;s totally fine that he spent his day on the couch. I have no qualms about that, because he probably needed the rest and still recovering from covid. What frustrates me is his attitude about it. He openly complained about feeling too tired to do anything today and that he feels like he should be doing more but doesn&#39;t know how.</p> <p>This conversation has happened many times. I lose my patience a little more each time we have this conversation - I need to reiterate, it has happened a lot. So today in the conversation I told him &quot;sometimes you just have to push yourself..&quot;. My thinking being that it can&#39;t always be easy and we need discipline to take care of the things we need to take care of even if we&#39;re tired or sick.</p> <p>That however made him very upset. He argued that instead of just &quot;pushing himself&quot;, I should know to think intuitively that he&#39;s not doing well and I should ask him how I can ease his load...</p> <p>Which to me frustrated me even more, because he honestly sat on the couch the entire day. This is not new behavior for him when parents watch our son and he has time off. Some days he will go out and run errands, but I would say about half of the days he does not do anything (or at the very least a load of laundry). There have been plenty of days where he sits and plays a game with his time. Again, totally fine to do, but in my head if by doing so you should accept the consequences of your actions. </p> <p>When he complains about this stuff, it almost reads to me as though he&#39;s trying to garner sympathy or wanting me to baby him and say &quot;oh hunny, it&#39;s fine&quot;, and make him feel better about his choice to do nothing with his day, but I don&#39;t agree with that. I think that if you&#39;re going to choose to do nothing with your day, at least embrace it and feel good about it, accepting it, but don&#39;t take advantage and be sure to make up for it in some fashion..</p> <p>It&#39;s just complaining to me about that stuff seems insensitive, because there are some nights where after our son goes to bed I have to do more work and I also work on some weekend evenings when I&#39;m not watching him - I only wish to ever have a stretch of 3 hours to myself where I don&#39;t have to do anything, yet he gets this every single week night and at least once a week he&#39;ll get the entire day to himself while our son is being watched.</p> <p>Anyways, I&#39;m having a hard time not getting frustrated and am wondering if what I&#39;m feeling is valid or if I should be easier on him.</p> <p>TL;DR: Husband is SAHD and openly complains about not doing anything with their time off and it&#39;s become very frustrating to hear.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok_Somewhere9862\"> /u/Ok_Somewhere9862 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/18ipnc7/frustrated_with_my_33f_husband_34m_and_not_sure/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/18ipnc7/frustrated_with_my_33f_husband_34m_and_not_sure/\">[comments]</a></span>"}], "summary": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi all, I just want to check in and see what others think.
