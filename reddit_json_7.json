I\u2019m just scared that she will see me as an ATM because having a kid is expensive and I\u2019d like to have at least a semblance of a chance at being a homeowner one day. Anyone that\u2019s been through something similar, how do you lay down the law? I genuinely am scared for when I start to make money.
