Is there anything I can do to help her? I can get over not having the idealized best friend sisters relationship with her where we do everything together, but she is very clearly unhappy the way she is. It would be good for her if she lost weight, obviously, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s where her problems really stem from.</p> <p>TL:DR; My younger sister is extremely self conscious and no matter what I try she just wants to isolate herself.
